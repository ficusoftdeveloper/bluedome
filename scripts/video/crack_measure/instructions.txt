in the same folder of the script must be the file outpun_bin.png
output of crack_detection.py

 modify the last line of the script crack_detection.py with
cv2.imwrite('output_bin.png',bw_result*255)



python crack_measure.py

with this command the results are in pixels

or 

python crack_measure.py 10

where 10 is the length of a pixel in cm or mm
to have the results in cm or mm

the script writes 3 files as output

measures.png
measures.csv
measures_sum.csv

in measures.csv there are the measures for each oblect that you
see in measures.png

then if two pieces are near the are considered the same crack, ID_CRACK in measures.csv
and in measures_sum.csv there are the sum of all the pieces of the full cracks
